# Chess
Chess is a game created using C# in Visual Studio. Users can signup and login and choose how many minutes each player will have to make their moves. When a player makes a move, their opponent's remaining time continues to decrease. The game ends when either some player runs out of time, either when a king gets captured or when a draw occurs. The application keeps track of how many victories, draws and defeats each registered player has and shows the leaderboard based on Victories or based on Winrate. All data is saved and restored from a database.
